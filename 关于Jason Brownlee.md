# 关于

Hello, my name is Jason Brownlee, PhD.

I’m a father, husband, professional developer, and machine learning practitioner.

I have a few higher degrees in Artificial Intelligence and I’ve worked on machine learning systems for defense, startups, and severe weather forecasting.

I started this community for two main reasons:

1) Because I find **machine learning endlessly fascinating**.

2) Because I want to help developers **get started** and **get good at** applied machine learning.

I see a lot of developers not getting started, “getting ready” to get started, and generally studying the wrong things, and I think it is a huge waste of time.

I created this site to show developers another way.


大家好，我是Jason Brownlee博士。

我是一位父亲、丈夫、高级开发员和机器学习实践者。

我有几个工智能高学位，我曾为国防、创业公司和恶劣气象天气预测的机器学习系统工作。

我创建这个社区，有两个主要原因：

1) 因为我发现**机器学习乐趣无穷**。

2) 因为我想帮助开发人员**开始**并**擅长应用**机器学习。

我看见许多开发人员没有开始或“准备好”开始，且通常学习了错误的东西，我认为这是巨大的浪费时间。

为了向开发人员展示另一种方式，我创建了这个网站。

## Are You Feeling Overwhelmed!?
I know what it is like to feel overwhelmed by the vast amounts of blogs, courses, books, papers and software tools available on machine learning.

It is difficult to know where to start and how to know which resources are worth the effort.

It is easy to feel confused by the theoretical and mathematical introductions to machine learning algorithms and thinking that there must be an easier path.

You are not alone. There are thousands of developers that also feel overwhelmed.

I used to be an overwhelmed developer.

## 你是感到不知所措吗？
我知道那种被大量关于机器学习的博客、课程、书籍、论文和软件工具所淹没的那种感觉。

很难知道从哪里开始和如何知道哪些资源更值得付出努力。

人们很容易对机器学习算法的理论和数学介绍感到困惑，认为一定有另一条更容易的道路。

你不是一个人。有数成千上万的开发人员同样感到不知所措。

我曾经是个不知所措的开发人员。


## An Interested Amateur
It wasn’t that long ago that I was a developer and then a professional software engineer interested in machine learning.

I read blogs and websites and did not **understand the theory or the mathematics** that I believed I had to before I could apply the algorithms.

**I desperately wanted to get started** applying machine learning but I was hung up on the theory and the academic side and I could not move forward.

I felt like I was spinning my wheels and not getting anywhere.

## 感兴趣的业余
不久之前，我是一名开发人员，然后是一名对机器学习感兴趣的专业软件工程师。

我阅读博客和网站，**不理解我认为在我应用这些算法之前必须理解的理论或数学**。<font size=1.5> （not understand...that I believed I had to 不理解...我以为必须理解的... ）</font>

**我迫切的想要开始**机器学习，但是被理论和学术所困，不得前进。

我感觉在原地打转，哪也去不了。

## Use Self-Study Small Projects
I knew the solution and was using it effectively, but it took me years to see it for what it was.

As a professional software developer, it was part of my job to stay on top of tools, techniques, APIs and programming languages.

Like many developers, I do this by **designing and executing small projects** on the side that use a tool or technique in order for me **to learn it through applying it**.

I was using this methodology to teach myself machine learning on the side. I even used this strategy to get me through two higher degrees, that I now realize I didn’t need to get.

Yes, you can be highly effective and deliver tons of value in business with the tools of applied machine learning, without getting a Ph.D.!

## 使用自学小项目
我知道解决方案，且有效的使用，但是花费我多年才知道它是什么。

作为一名专业的软件开发人员，掌握(stay on top of...)工具、技术、API和编程语言是我的一部分工作。

想许多开发人员一样，我通过 **设计和执行使用工具或技术的（on the side that）小项目**，以**便我通过应用来学习它**。<font size=1.5> (in order to...引导目的状语从句，以便...)</font>

我使用这种方法自学机器学习<font size=1.5> (each myself自学)</font>，我甚至使用这种策略获得两个现在意识到我并不需要的高等学位。

是的，即使没有博士学位，你也可以高效地使用机器学习工具，并在商业领域创造巨大的价值。

## Learn from my Missteps
It was difficult when my interest in machine learning was kindled in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

There were a few sites out there, but nothing that I felt spoke to me as first an interested programmer and later, a professional programmer.

I spent hundreds of dollars on thick academic textbooks that I could not understand or appreciate until many years later.

Machine learning is described in academic language from books, papers, and even websites. I felt (I now believe wrongly) that I had to get higher degrees to figure this stuff out. I quit my job and went back to school to earn a Masters and Ph.D. degrees.

I completed my research work leveraging the skills I already had as a professional developer: **designing and executing small projects in order to learn and master skills**.

## 从我的错误中吸取教训
在19世纪90年代和20世纪初，在我对机器学习激起兴趣时是非常困难。

有少许网站，但对感觉我来说没有什么东西作为我第一个感兴趣的程序员，和后来成为专业程序员。

我在那些厚厚的直到多年后我能理解和欣赏的教材上花费成百上千美元。

来自书籍、论文甚至是网站上的机器学习被使用学术语言描述。我感觉（现在认为是错误的）我必须获得更高的学位来弄清除它们。我辞掉我的工作并回到学校，以便获得一个硕士学位和博士学位。

我借助我作为一名高级开发人员所具有的经验——**设计和执行小项目，以便学习和掌握技能**，完成了我的研究工作。

## Apply Machine Learning
I have come full circle and happily became a professional developer again.

I started working with severe weather meteorologists to solve complex problems for real users that are interested and excited about the solutions.

I can **confidently wield machine learning algorithms** to solve problems at work, for clients, and even for myself when participating in competitions or creating my own software.

I now spend my days working with developers to get started and really kick ass with applied machine learning.

## 应用机器学习
我走了一圈，很愉快地再次成为一名高级开发人员。

我开始与恶劣天气气象专家合作，为那对方案感兴趣和兴奋的真实用户解决复杂问题。

对客户的工作或者对我自己当参加竞赛或者创建属于自己软件，我都能够**自信地挥舞机器学习算法**来解决问题。
